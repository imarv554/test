# CREDIFY Deployment Guide

## Current Status âœ…

Your CREDIFY application is ready for deployment to credifymvp.netlify.app!

## Automated Deployment (Recommended)

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Automatic)
1. **Merge Pull Request**: Go to https://github.com/credify1/credify/pull/4 
2. **Review Changes**: The PR includes:
   - `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
   - `public/_redirects` - SPA routing configuration
3. **Merge to Main**: Once merged, Netlify will automatically:
   - Detect the changes
   - Run `bun run build` 
   - Deploy to credifymvp.netlify.app

## Manual Deployment Options

### Option 2: Netlify Web Interface
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Login to your account
3. Find your "credifymvp" site
4. Go to "Deploys" tab
5. Drag and drop the `dist` folder or use "Deploy manually"

### Option 3: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to your account
netlify login

# Deploy to your site
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --site=credifymvp
```

## Environment Variables

Currently, no environment variables are required for the frontend. The application uses:
- Mock data for development/testing
- Concordium blockchain integration (client-side)
- No server-side API dependencies in current build

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:

1. **Homepage loads correctly** at https://credifymvp.netlify.app
2. **Navigation works**: Click "Start Shopping" and "Become a Seller"
3. **SPA routing**: Test direct URL access like `/marketplace`
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on mobile devices
5. **Concordium wallet integration**: Install browser wallet and test connection

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify `bun.lock` is committed to repository
3. Ensure Node.js version is set to 20+ in build settings

### If routing doesn't work:
1. Verify `_redirects` file is in the deployed site
2. Check that `netlify.toml` redirects are configured
3. Test with incognito/private browser window

### If assets don't load:
1. Check that files exist in `/assets/` directory
2. Verify build completed successfully
3. Check browser developer console for errors

## Support

For additional deployment support:
- Check Netlify build logs at app.netlify.com
- Review GitHub Actions if automated deployments are configured
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed
