### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS V4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Lucide icons
- **Blockchain**: Concordium Web SDK for mainnet integration
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust with Concordium SDK
- **Package Manager**: Bun for fast development
- **Deployment**: Production-ready with multiple hosting options

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Bun package manager
- Rust (for smart contracts)
- Concordium Browser Wallet extension

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd credify-platform
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
bun install
```

3. **Start development server**:
```bash
bun run dev
```

4. **Build for production**:
```bash
bun run build
```

### Smart Contract Development

1. **Navigate to contracts directory**:
```bash
cd contracts
```

2. **Build contracts**:
```bash
./build.sh
```

3. **Deploy to Concordium mainnet** (requires funded account):
```bash
concordium-client module deploy credify_escrow.wasm.v1 --sender YOUR_ACCOUNT
concordium-client module deploy credify_reputation.wasm.v1 --sender YOUR_ACCOUNT  
concordium-client module deploy credify_dispute.wasm.v1 --sender YOUR_ACCOUNT
```

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Identity Verification
Users connect their Concordium wallet and complete identity verification through zero-knowledge proofs. This enables age-restricted purchases without revealing personal information.

### 2. Smart Contract Escrow
When a purchase is made, funds are held in a smart contract escrow until the buyer confirms receipt. This protects both parties and enables automated dispute resolution.

### 3. Reputation System
Every successful transaction builds reputation tokens that cannot be transferred but provide portable trust scores across the platform.

### 4. Dispute Resolution
If disputes arise, the community votes on resolutions using a DAO-based system weighted by reputation scores.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_CONCORDIUM_NETWORK=mainnet
VITE_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
VITE_REPUTATION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
VITE_DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
```

### Contract Deployment
Update contract addresses in `src/config/contracts.ts` after deployment.
